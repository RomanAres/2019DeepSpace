For naming paths:

The start point and end destination are separated by a "_"
Example:
<where you start>_<where you end>

The start point contains, in this order, the side of the field/hab, the place, and the position of the arm.
Example:
RightHab1Front

The the end point contains, in this order, the side of the field/hab, the place, the game piece,
    the height of the elevator, and the position of the arm, unless some of these don't apply.
Example:
LeftRocketHatchHighFront
RightLoadingStationBack, (In this case the game piece and elevator height don't matter.)

In the case of places on the cargo ship, the space normally taken by side of the field is instead the
    region of the cargo ship. (The left side, the center, or the right side.) The space taken normally
    by the elevator height will instead be the part of the cargo ship we want to score to. (far, center,
    or close for the sides, and left or right for the front.)
